This is Tanaguru Contrast-Finder for Firefox

This addon speeds and eases the use of [Tanaguru Contrast-Finder](http://contrast-finder.tanaguru.com/) to find good colors for contrasts in web accessibility (a11y).

## Usage

Right-clic on a given part of text, select whether you want to improve the foreground or background color, and validate.

* If the contrast between text color (foreground) and the background is correct, you will have an informative message.
* On the other hand, if the contrast is not valid, you will be directed a "result page" of Contrast-Finder giving you choices of colors that create valid contrast options.
